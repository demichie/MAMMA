To run the code copy the executable from the bin folder to the examples folder and then launch the executable:

./MAMMA

In the PLOTTING_SCRIPTS folder there are several Matlab scripts to plot the solution of the model.

If the code is launched without an input file, a new one will be created with default values to reproduce the simulation for the MSH1980 eruption, as presented in Degryuter et al. 2012.
